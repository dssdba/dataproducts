The purpose of this project is two parts.

The first part is to write and deploy a shiny application.  The application can be found at <http://dssdba.shinyapps.io/NormalDistributionDemo>.

The purpose of this demonstration is to show how test simulation of rexp(n,lambda) means gravitate towards a normal distribution as n increases.

The slider on the shinyapp.io page is selectable in 100 simulation increments.

The checkbox shows or hides the normal distribution curve.

As the numbers exceed 1000, notice how the histogram bars come closer to the curve.

The second part of this assignment is to create a reproducable pitch presentation.

The pitch can be found at <http://rpubs???> and in this github respository at ReproduciblePitch.md and .Rpres files.
